    <h1> Raven Rain Diaz </h1>

     <!-- p is a paragraph; there is default spacing around the paragraph -->
    <p> Meet Raven, my sweet four-year-old miniature husky. Weighing around 19 pounds, she's a small package of pure love and energy!
         Interestingly, people often mistake her for a boy, but she's definitely a girl! Raven adores long walks and is always ready for playtime, being quite respectful when meeting new faces. She came into my life thanks to a kind neighbor who brought her up from Mexico, and I'm forever grateful. More than just a pet, Raven is my Emotional Support Animal. For someone like me managing anxiety and depression, her presence is everything. 
        She seems to sense exactly when I need her, staying right by my side to offer comfort simply by being there. </p>
