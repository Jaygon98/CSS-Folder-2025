                <p>Meet Raven, my sweet four-year-old miniature husky. Weighing around 19 pounds, she's a small package of pure love and energy! Interestingly, people often mistake her for a boy, but she's definitely a girl! Raven adores long walks and is always ready for playtime, being quite respectful when meeting new faces. She came into my life thanks to a kind neighbor who brought her up from Mexico, and I'm forever grateful.</p>

                <p>More than just a pet, Raven is my Emotional Support Animal. For someone like me managing anxiety and depression, her presence is everything. She seems to sense exactly when I need her, staying right by my side to offer comfort simply by being there. For example, when I'm feeling overwhelmed or having a panic attack, she'll often gently nudge my hand with her nose or lay her head on my lap, offering a quiet, grounding presence that helps me breathe and feel less alone.</p>

                <p>Raven isn't just a pet; she's an integral part of my daily life and emotional well-being. Her playful spirit and unwavering loyalty bring so much joy and stability. Every day with her is an adventure, filled with happy moments and quiet comfort.</p>
