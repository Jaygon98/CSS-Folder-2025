<h1>Raven Rain Diaz</h1>
<p>  Meet Raven, my sweet four-year-old miniature husky. Weighing around 19 pounds, she's a small package of pure love and energy! 
        Interestingly, people often mistake her for a boy, but she's definitely a girl!
         Raven adores long walks and is always ready for playtime, being quite respectful when meeting new faces. 
         She came into my life thanks to a kind neighbor who brought her up from Mexico, and I'm forever grateful. 
         More than just a pet, Raven is my Emotional Support Animal. For someone like me managing anxiety and depression, her presence is everything. 
         She seems to sense exactly when I need her, staying right by my side to offer comfort simply by being there.</p>
